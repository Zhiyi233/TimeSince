# Vision Statement

Time Since is an application to keep track of when the user last did something.

## Description

Time Since is an application for keeping track of user-defined events so that
the users don't have to remember everything, thus making their lives easier.
It can also help in adopting good habits, or quitting bad ones. Time Since is
a lifestyle application, that can be used for reminders, self-help, and life
tracking.

Time Since will allow users to select events from a preset list or create their
own. Some of our presets include 'changed toothbrush', 'washed bed sheets',
'watered plants', and 'cleaned floor'. These will also include a base time
frequency for how often these should be repeated, but the user can change them
to fit their needs.

Additionally, users will be able to organize their list of events by adding
labels to fit categories (presets include 'kitchen', 'hygiene', 'addiction',
and 'laundry'), and selecting some to add to a favourites list. Users can use
these labels to see only a portion of their events, which can provide a clear
picture of their tasks, and lessen the feeling of being overwhelmed.

Another main element of Time Since is the ability to view the list of events in
a variety of ways. Users can sort by when they added it, alphabetically, the
time frame between occurrences, and what is the next upcoming event. The
application will provide users with two ways of viewing their events; as a
general list, and a more detailed look at a single event.

## Users

Time Since is designed for anyone who wants to keep their lives organized, and
stay on top of daily, monthly, or yearly chores. This application can also be
extremely beneficial for people with early-onset Dementia, people with
Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), or those with poor memories for
any reason. Time Since can also be used to help people build good habits, or to
try and break bad ones. Addicts can use it to encourage themselves on their
lifelong road of recovery, and reward themselves at certain milestones.

## Value

Time Since is a vast improvement over using your brain to try and remember when
you last did something, and when you should be doing it again. It can be very
difficult and a waste of energy to try and remember all of these events, or to
try and find where you wrote it down. Our application helps people keep a more
organized and scheduled life, and aids in trying to keep or break habits. Time
Since is valuable for everyone, but can be an extra tool for people with
early-onset Dementia, ADHD, or poor memories. While there are similar
applications on the market, most are either unintuitive, too complicated, or
don't have enough capability. Unlike these applications, Time Since is more
user-friendly, easy to get started with, continue using, and customizable.

## Success Criteria

We will measure Time Since's success based on a few criteria. The first would
be that our application is intuitive and easy enough to use that people will
want to choose it over alternative applications currently on the market, or
the more traditional method of writing on a piece of paper. This would be
measured by application downloads and user reviews.
Secondly, we will look for users who don't delete the application for at least
three months after downloading it.
Thirdly, a ten percent increase in active users each month for the first six
months. Lastly, we will consider our application a success if the average user
rating is four or higher (out of five).
